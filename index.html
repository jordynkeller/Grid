            <h2>What Is CSS Grid</h2>
            CSS Grid is a layout system that consists of both rows and columns, allowing the user to be able to manipulate a part of their site in 2 dimensions. This makes styling websites a lot easier, before grid was created a lot of developers used the table element to mimic what a grid can do. This was a huge pain for most people, so when grid was created developers and designers alike rejoiced! CSS Grid was introduced in 2012 by Bert Bos, and his associate HÃ¥kon Wium Lie. Grid started as a very simple way to show content on a very small screen. When grid was first introduced developers/designers all over the world looked at it as a revolutionary way to change the layout of pages, and to this day is used in hundreds of websites all over the Internet.

            <h2>How to Build a Grid Container</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <h3>Grid Container</h3>
            <p>To make a Grid Container you must set the display property to grid or inline-grid.</p>
            <p>Grid containers are made up of grid itemds placed inside of columns and rows.</p>
            <p>The following is an example of a grid container</p>

            <div class="grid-container">
              <div>1</div>
              <div>2</div>
              <div>3</div>
              <div>4</div>
            </div>

            <p>To achive this, first a create a div with a class of "grid-container"</p>
            <p>Next, I create additional div elements for each column I want my grid to have. Direct child elements of the grid container automatically become grid items.</p>

            <p>Lastly, I add custom CSS for how I would like to grid to display on the website.</p>

                    <h3>grid-column</h3>
                    <p>The <span class="property">grid-column</span> property is shorthand for 
                    <span class="property">grid-column-start</span> and <span class="property">grid-column-end</span> 
                    which determine the start and end position of a grid item.</p>
